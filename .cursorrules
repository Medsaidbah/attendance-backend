- Implement: /auth/login (stub), /geofence (GeoJSON upsert), /time-windows (replace-all), /presence/check (server rule).
- Use PostGIS for point-in-polygon with spatial indexes.
- Separate events (facts) from attendances (decisions).
- English in code/comments; French for user strings.
- No external backends (no Supabase/Firebase).
- Keep functions short with docstrings. Minimal, runnable code.
